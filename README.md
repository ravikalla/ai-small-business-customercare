## Features

### How It Works - Simple Example

**Step 1: Business Setup** *(Business Owner's WhatsApp)*

| Who | Message |
|-----|---------|
| **Business Owner:** | Hi, I want to set up AI for my restaurant "Indian PizzaHut" |
| **AI Assistant:** | Hello! I'll help you set up your AI assistant. Tell me about your business. |
| **Business Owner:** | We are a restaurant. We're open 9AM to 10PM daily. We serve Indian-style pizzas and fusion dishes. |
| **Business Owner:** | [Uploads menu PDF] |
| **AI Assistant:** | Perfect! Your menu and business info have been saved. Your AI assistant is now ready to help customers! |

**Step 2: Customer Experience** *(Customer's WhatsApp)*

| Who | Message |
|-----|---------|
| **Customer:** | Hi! What breakfast options do you have? |
| **PizzaHut AI:** | Good morning! We serve 'Pani Puri Pizza' and 'Masala Dosa Pizza' between 9AM-11AM. Our breakfast menu includes Indian fusion items perfect for morning cravings. Would you like to see our full menu? |
| **Customer:** | What are your hours? |
| **PizzaHut AI:** | We're open daily from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM. You can place orders anytime during these hours! |
| **Customer:** | Do you deliver to downtown? |
| **PizzaHut AI:** | Yes! We deliver to downtown within 30 minutes. Delivery fee is $5 for orders under $50. |

**Key Benefits:**
- **Zero Training Required**: Customers use natural language, no special commands needed
- **Instant Setup**: Register your business and upload knowledge in minutes  
- **24/7 Availability**: Your AI assistant never sleeps, never takes breaks
- **Cost Savings**: Reduce customer service staff while improving response times

- **Automated Monitoring**: Health checks, alerts, and daily reports

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys:

3. Create Pinecone index:
- Create an index with dimension 1536 (for OpenAI embeddings)
- Use cosine similarity metric
- Choose appropriate cloud and region

4. Start the application:

**Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Usage

### Upload Knowledge Base
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/upload \
  -F "document=@your-file.pdf" \

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are your business hours?", "businessId": "business123"}'
```

### WhatsApp Integration

#### For Business Owners:
1. Scan QR code when starting the app
2. Register your business: `!register [Business Name]`
3. Add knowledge: `!add [text content]`
4. Upload documents via WhatsApp attachments (PDF, TXT)
5. Manage knowledge: `!list`, `!delete [id]`, `!help`

#### For Customers:
1. Query using: `!business [businessId] [question]`
2. Example: `!business restaurant123 What are your opening hours?`
3. Get AI-powered responses from business knowledge base
